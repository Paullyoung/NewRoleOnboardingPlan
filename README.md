# Onboarding Plan: The First 90 Days Inspired Guide

## Introduction

Welcome to your onboarding guide, inspired by the famous book *The First 90 Days* by Michael D. Watkins. This book is a big deal because it gives clear, practical advice on how to do well quickly in a new job, especially in leadership roles. This plan uses ideas from the book (and quotes of key sections) to help you fit in, get up to speed, and start making a difference in your new role as soon as possible.

## Key Principles
Do these things well, and you'll be set up for success:

_- Prepare yourself. This means making a mental break from your old job and preparing to take charge in the new one
- Accelerate your learning. You need to climb the learning curve as fast as you can in your new organization. This means understanding its markets, products, technologies, systems, and structures, as well as its culture and politics. You must be systematic and focused about deciding what you need to learn and how you will learn it most efficiently.
- Secure early wins. Early wins build your credibility and create momentum. In the first few weeks, you need to identify opportunities to build personal credibility. In the first 90 days, you need to identify ways to create value and improve business results.
- Negotiate success. Because no other single relationship is more important, you need to figure out how to build a productive working relationship with your new boss (or bosses) and manage her expectations. Ensure you're aligned on your 90 day plan.
- Create coalitions. Supportive alliances, both internal and external, are necessary if you are to achieve your goals. You therefore should start right away to identify those whose support is essential for your success, and to figure out how to line them up on your side.
- Keep your balance. In the personal and professional tumult of a transition, you must work hard to maintain your equilibrium and preserve your ability to make good judgments. The risks of losing perspective, becoming isolated, and making bad calls are ever present during transitions - ensure you have the right advisors.
- Accelerate everyone. Finally, you need to help all those in your organization—direct reports, bosses, and peers—accelerate their own transitions. The fact that you’re in transition means they are too.

### Transition Traps to be aware of
There are some common potholes new hires can fall into, so be wary for:

_Sticking with what you know. You believe you will be successful in the new role by doing the same things you did in your previous role,
Setting unrealistic expectations. You don’t negotiate your mandate or establish clear, achievable objectives.
Attempting to do too much. You rush off in all directions, launching multiple initiatives in the hope that some will pay off.
Coming in with “the” answer. You come in with your mind made up, or you reach conclusions too quickly about “the” problems and “the” solutions. You alienate people who could help you understand
Falling prey to the 'action imperitive' - you try to do too much, too fast._
_Perhaps the biggest pitfall you face is assuming that what has made you successful to this point will continue to do so. The dangers of sticking with what you know, working extremely hard at doing it, and failing miserably are very real._

## Conclusion

The first 90 days are crucial for setting yourself up for success. By focusing on understanding the culture, making connections, getting some early wins, and planning for the future, you can become effective quickly and make a lasting impact. Remember, this plan is just a starting point. Feel free to adjust it as you learn more about your job, the company, and what works best for you.
