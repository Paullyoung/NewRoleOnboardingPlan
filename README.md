# NewRoleOnboardingPlan
A generic 30/60/90 day onboarding plan for a new role, based on the book 'The First 90 Days' by Michael Watkins

# Onboarding Plan: Inspired by Watkin's 'First 90 Days'

## Introduction

Welcome to your onboarding guide, inspired by highly regarded business book *The First 90 Days* by Michael D. Watkins. This book gives clear, practical advice on how to do well quickly in a new job, especially in leadership roles. This plan uses ideas from the book (and quotes of key sections) to help you fit in, get up to speed, and start making a difference in your new role as soon as possible. Note that the focus is primarily on a role that is 'first of its kind' in a larger company (not a role that adopts an existing team, or needs to define itself in a pure startup environment)

## Key Principles
Do these things well, and you'll be set up for success:

_- Prepare yourself. This means making a mental break from your old job and preparing to take charge in the new one
- Accelerate your learning. You need to climb the learning curve as fast as you can in your new organization. This means understanding its markets, products, technologies, systems, and structures, as well as its culture and politics. You must be systematic and focused about deciding what you need to learn and how you will learn it most efficiently.
- Secure early wins. Early wins build your credibility and create momentum. In the first few weeks, you need to identify opportunities to build personal credibility. In the first 90 days, you need to identify ways to create value and improve business results.
- Negotiate success. Because no other single relationship is more important, you need to figure out how to build a productive working relationship with your new boss (or bosses) and manage her expectations. Ensure you're aligned on your 90 day plan.
- Create coalitions. Supportive alliances, both internal and external, are necessary if you are to achieve your goals. You therefore should start right away to identify those whose support is essential for your success, and to figure out how to line them up on your side.
- Keep your balance. In the personal and professional tumult of a transition, you must work hard to maintain your equilibrium and preserve your ability to make good judgments. The risks of losing perspective, becoming isolated, and making bad calls are ever present during transitions - ensure you have the right advisors.
- Accelerate everyone. Finally, you need to help all those in your organization—direct reports, bosses, and peers—accelerate their own transitions. The fact that you’re in transition means they are too.

## 30-Day Plan: Getting Started
_No matter how much preparation time you get, start planning what you hope to accomplish by specific milestones.
Begin by thinking about your first day in the new job. What do you want to do by the end of that day? Then move to the first week. Then focus on the end of the first month, the second month, and finally the three-month mark. These plans will be sketchy, but the simple act of beginning to plan will help clear your head. At the broadest level, preparing yourself means letting go of the past and embracing the imperatives of the new situation to give yourself a running start. It can be hard work, but it is essential. Often, promising managers fail in new roles because they’ve failed to prepare themselves by embracing the necessary changes in perspective._
_Getting oriented to the business means learning about the company as a whole and not only your specific parts of the business.
To adapt successfully, you need to understand what the culture is overall and how it’s manifested in the organization or unit you’re joining

#The most important focus for the initial 30 days will be in building relationships and understanding the culture, while also defining a clear learning agenda for the rest of your 90 day onboarding process#

_The first task in making a successful transition is to accelerate your learning. Effective learning gives you the foundational insights you need as you build your plan for the next 90 days. It is essential to figure out what you need to know about your new organization and then to learn it as rapidly as you can. The more efficiently and effectively you learn, the more quickly you will close your window of vulnerability.
                
The faster you climb the learning curve, the earlier you can begin to make good business decisions. Amid the torrent of information coming your way, it’s easy to miss important signals. Or you might focus too much on the technical side of the business—products, customers, technologies, and strategies—and miss key elements of the organizational culture.
Planning to learn means figuring out in advance what the important questions are and how you can best answer them. Effective learning calls for figuring out what you need to learn so that you can focus your efforts. Remember: simply displaying a genuine desire to learn and understand translates into increased credibility and influence._

#Develop Your Learning Agenda#
_Devote some time to defining your learning agenda as early as possible, and return to it periodically to refine and supplement it. Efficient learning means identifying the best available sources of insight and then figuring out how to extract maximum insight with the least possible outlay of time.
The starting point is to begin to define your learning agenda, ideally before you formally enter the organization. A learning agenda crystallizes your learning priorities: what do you most need to learn? It consists of a focused set of questions to guide your inquiry or the hypotheses you want to explore and test, or both. Of course, learning during a transition is iterative: at first, your learning agenda will consist mostly of questions, but as you learn more, you will hypothesize about what is going on and why.
A smart approach is to use a standard set of questions about the business. This approach is powerful, because the responses you get are comparable. You can line them up side by side and analyze what is consistent and inconsistent about the responses.

- What are the biggest challenges the organization is facing (or will face in the near future)? 
- Why is the organization facing (or going to face) these challenges? 
- What are the most promising unexploited opportunities for growth? 
- What would need to happen for the organization to exploit the potential of these opportunities? 
- If you were me, what would you focus attention on?_

### Transition Traps to be aware of
There are some common potholes new hires can fall into, so be wary for:

_Sticking with what you know. You believe you will be successful in the new role by doing the same things you did in your previous role,
Setting unrealistic expectations. You don’t negotiate your mandate or establish clear, achievable objectives.
Attempting to do too much. You rush off in all directions, launching multiple initiatives in the hope that some will pay off.
Coming in with “the” answer. You come in with your mind made up, or you reach conclusions too quickly about “the” problems and “the” solutions. You alienate people who could help you understand
Falling prey to the 'action imperitive' - you try to do too much, too fast._
_Perhaps the biggest pitfall you face is assuming that what has made you successful to this point will continue to do so. The dangers of sticking with what you know, working extremely hard at doing it, and failing miserably are very real._

## Conclusion

The first 90 days are crucial for setting yourself up for success. By focusing on understanding the culture, making connections, getting some early wins, and planning for the future, you can become effective quickly and make a lasting impact. Remember, this plan is just a starting point. Feel free to adjust it as you learn more about your job, the company, and what works best for you.
